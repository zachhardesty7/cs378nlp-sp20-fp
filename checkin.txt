While reading the original paper published with the dataset,
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250, I took special interest in the methods and results of
analysis done by Stanford on the questions. They took fairly simple steps to categorize
the questions based on type. A specific interest was categorizing nouns into "person,
location and other entities using NER tags." This falls into the "Linguistic
Constraints" category. I think it would be interesting to pre-process the data in some
way. This could be something like using NER or dependency parsing to define relationships between
words, such as a "quality, property, or version." Perhaps this could be used to determine the named
entity that a question is asking for and focus the relevant parts of the article before
selecting a phrase as it currently does.

The suggested library, spaCy, seems particularly useful since it supports both of these
processing methods. Also, I like their documentation page best so far. The library
targets beginners and could prove the most likely to generate significant accuracy
improvement with a minimal amount of time spent buried in documentation and research
papers. 

One other area that could be useful is focusing on marking questions as unanswerable
earlier in the process if they don't have any noun phrases in the paragraph. Like, if
the question is asking for a property of a noun and the paragraph has no phrases with
properties of nouns.
